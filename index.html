                     with software development / electronics / reverse engineering. My major areas of interests are Java based applications related with Spring
                      and Android ecosystems.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">This is so far my biggest project. I created it for my friend who needed a custom platform to schedule appointments between his providers (teachers) and his
                             customers (students). 
                            Admin can add providers and available services. Providers can set their weekly working plan, 
                            add breaks to their plan
                             and choose which service they offer. Customers can book appointments for their selected service and provider with just a few clicks. Every appointment has 7 possible statuses: scheduled, canceled, finished, confirmed, rejection requested, rejection accepted, invoiced. Normal lifecycle of appointment is:
                             scheduled -> finished -> confirmed -> invoiced. On the 1st day of each month invoices are issued automaticaly for every customer for his all confirmed appointments. For every appointment status change an email notification is sent to provider/customer. More informations about logic (cancelation rules, rejections rules etc) can be found on github readme page.

                            <p class="text-justify">This is my first android application created while learning Android SDK. The main purpose of this application is to inform users 
                                what is the mean waiting time in a choosen restaurant. It allows user to do two things: add new restaurant which is not yet int
                                 the database or add new time report to an existing restuarant. Every time reports expires after 1 hour and is deleted automatically. The mean waiting time 
                                 for each restuarnat is just an arithmetic mean calculated from active time reports. It communicates with google Places API to retrieve restaurant details and with 
                                HowLong App REST Api (described above) to store time reports and restaurasnt details in remote database. </p>
